# Catfish Dungeon Generator
A random roguelike dungeon generator intended to be used as inspiration for roleplaying oneshots

Created with NextJS and a couple ounces of time

## Setting Up
- Clone the repo
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`
- Go to `localhost:3000` in a browser

## Intention
This project was a sudden idea to make a random dungeon generator that would act as a visual and textual prompt for roleplaying oneshots (for example, D&D), with a thematic focus on being a roguelike dungeon crawler experience.  It does not and will not generate a full, comprehensive, or even necessarily understandable dungeon, but it _will_ provide some fun randomly-generated ideas and layouts you can use to inspire your own sessions.

#### The originally intended use case:
A group of friends want a casual roleplaying dungeon adventure where they can just jump in without the DM having to prepare a lot of content in advance.  The DM loads up the dungeon generator, sets a few options based on what the party is feeling like doing (ex. more combat or more neat items), then hits generate and suddenly \*bam\* a rough room layout, random items and monsters, and a couple points of interest appear on screen.  The DM picks a room for the party to start in and rolls with it, handling descriptions and combat and interactions however they want, but using the generated content as a prompt to inspire them (and save time and effort).  It's very much improvised, but the DM has a fun time interpreting what the generator gave them, and the party has a fun time encountering new things around every corner!

## Usage
- I have no idea lol, it's not usable yet
